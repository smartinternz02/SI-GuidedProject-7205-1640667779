# Detection of Phishing Websites from URLs using IBM Watson Studio

## Introduction
A phishing website is a common social engineering system that mimics trusting invariant resource locators (URLs) and webpages. The ideal of this design is to train machine Learning models using Logistic Regression on the dataset created to prognosticate phishing websites. Both phishing and benign URLs of websites are gathered to form a dataset and from them needed URL and website content- grounded features are uprooted. The performance position of each model is measured and compared. 
Successful phishing scams can have a devastating impact. Even phishing attacks that target an organization or company affect the individuals who work for that organization, or customers and partners of that organization.It is Extremely important to Stop Phishing attacks. Hence we have decided to create a model to make it easier for people who have very little knowledge about how these Phishing scams take place so for them we have made this Project as it makes an easy prediction in a matter of Seconds.

## Proposed Solution
We have a solution which involves using the intelligence of computers that is using Artificial intelligence and Machine learning techniques, more specifically Logistic regression in these Techniques to create a web based Phishing detection toolbar interface with the help of python based Flask framework as backend to communicate with the ML trained Logistic regression models from a predefined data set with numerous amount of parameters to Accurately determine and inform us about a potential Phishing site upon inspection.

## Hardware / Software Designing

### Hardware Requirements :
  -A Generic PC with at least 8 GB ram  
  
  -A Tensorprocessing Unit for faster calculations and accurate model training  
  
  -A good Processor to handle all the operations

### Software Requirements :
  -A Windows / Linux / Mac Operating System  
  
  -Anaconda Installed including with all the Dependencies  
  
  -Spyder,Jupyter notebook and Flask for the entire application development.
  
### Deployment Requirements :
  -IBM cloud  
  
  -IBM Watson Studio
  
## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
  -Easily identifies trends and patterns in phishing sites  
  
  -Continuous Development  
  
  -Completely Automated  
  
  -Quickly Determines Malicious Sites as it has a lot of training  
  
  -Can be Integrated anywhere with online deployment  
  
  -Efficient

### Disadvantages
  -Data Acquisition  
  
  -Takes a lot of time to train models  
  
  -Efficiency is dependent upon the qualify Data acquired  
  
  -Prone to error as Phishing tactics change regularly  
  
  -Consumes a lot of CPU,GPU and TPU power to train models

## Applications

It has a wide range of application not just in terms of phishing detection but the technique used in it which is logistic regression

But first let's talk about phishing:

  -It can be used as generic checker if any someone is not sure about a website while entering personal information  
  
  -It can be shipped compacted and converted into an extension which can then be used by web browsers to quickly detect and alert the user instead of user check manually  
  
  -Can be integrated into antiviruses and firewalls to avoid and block such websites from accessing information.

Uses of the technique logistic Regression include :
  -Text analytics  
  
  -Simulations  
  
  -Descriptive Statistics  
  
  -Credit scoring  
  
  -Gaming
  
## Future scope

This application has a lot of improvements that can be made in the future as we have only used on of the many techniques that can be used with a variety of combinations to achieve the desired and more accurate results. Hence this project has a lot of future scope with neural networks and more vast data sets as Phishing tactics and techniques are constantly changing so we require a continuous improvement model to keep this application upto date in the future making space for further improvement.
